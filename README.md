  "Hi! My name is Tejpal Kumawat .I am a data scientist. My personal interest is in Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing.

  I am a second-year undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. I am pursuing  Btech in Chemical Engineering.
  I have a keen interest towards Artificial Intelligence. More specifically, I am particularly interested in Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
  To consolidate my knowledge, I am a programmer in Python. I have taken courses on Machine Learning and Deep learning."

# PROJECTS-

## Project 1:  Text Classifications in Deep Learning
"This project has sub projects which are totally based on text classification task using deep learning."

 ### [ Project 1.1: "DISASTER TWEETS ANANYSIS"](https://github.com/tejpal123456789/Natural-Language-Processing/blob/main/Diasaster_twitter_ananlysis.ipynb)
![](/images/disaster1.jpg)

 * Created a model which will take tweets from the twitter and classify that it will be disaster news or not.
 * Did Exploratory data analysis and analyse the length of the tweets with the help of histograms .
 * Use GLOVE (stanford nlp) to convert words into their corresponding word vectors.
 * Use Naive bayes Classifier and recurrent Neural Networks to make the model.
 * We find that Bidirectional LSTMs predict very efficiently.
 
 -------------------

 ### [ Project 1.2: "SPAM CLASSIFIER"](https://github.com/tejpal123456789/Natural-Language-Processing/blob/main/spam_classifer.ipynb)
 ![](/images/spam.jpg)

 * Created a deep learning model which will classify the text whether it is spam or ham.
 * Use nltk and spacy NLP libraries for preprocess the data.
 * Use keras word embeddings to convert the words into their corresponding word vectors.
 * Used LSTM(Recuurent Neural Networks) to train the model.

----------------------------
 ### [Project 1.3: "SARCASM DETECTION"](https://github.com/tejpal123456789/Natural-Language-Processing/blob/main/sarcasm_detection.ipynb)
![](/images/sarcasm.jpg)
 
 * Created a deep learning model which will classify the text whether it is spam or ham.
 * Use nltk and spacy NLP libraries for preprocess the data.
 * Use keras tensorflow word embeddings to convert the words into their corresponding word vectors.
 * Used Bidirectional LSTMs(Recuurent Neural Networks) to train the model.
 * Got the accuracy of 98% on the test data.


-------------------
## [Project 2:  ChatBot](https://github.com/tejpal123456789/Chatbot/blob/main/Chatbot.ipynb)
  ![](/images/resize-1618594701874869920chatbot2.jpg)
  
"This project is based on natural language processing which will chat with human like a human."

* Build a simple chatbot with the artificial neural networks
* Used nltk natural language processing library for preprocessing the text
* Used Bag of words for the converting the words into vectors
* Created model with the keras and Neural Networks and started chatting with the bot
