"Hi! My name is Tejpal Kumawat .I am a data scientist. My personal interest is in Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing.

I am a second-year undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. I am pursuing  Btech in Chemical Engineering.
I have a keen interest towards Artificial Intelligence. More specifically, I am particularly interested in Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
To consolidate my knowledge, I am a programmer in Python. I have taken courses on Machine Learning and Deep learning."

# PROJECTS-

## Project 1:  Text Classifications in Deep Learning"
"This project has sub projects which are totally based on text classification task using deep learning."

### Project 1.1: "DISASTER TWEETS ANANYSIS"

* Created a model which will take tweets from the twitter and classify that it will be disaster news or not.

* Did Exploratory data analysis and analyse the length of the tweets with the help of histograms .

* Use GLOVE (stanford nlp) to convert words into their corresponding word vectors.

* Use Naive bayes Classifier and recurrent Neural Networks to make the model.

* We find that Bidirectional LSTMs predict very efficiently.
