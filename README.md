  "Hi! My name is Tejpal Kumawat .I am a data scientist. My personal interest is in Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing.

  I am a second-year undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. I am pursuing  Btech in Chemical Engineering.
  I have a keen interest towards Artificial Intelligence. More specifically, I am particularly interested in Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
  To consolidate my knowledge, I am a programmer in Python. I have taken courses on Machine Learning and Deep learning.
  Here i have provided some of the major project that have done during my learning"

# PROJECTS-

## Project 1:  Text Classifications in Deep Learning
"This project has sub projects which are totally based on text classification task using deep learning."

### [ Project 1.1: "DISASTER TWEETS ANANYSIS"](https://github.com/tejpal123456789/Natural-Language-Processing/blob/main/Diasaster_twitter_ananlysis.ipynb)
![](/images/disaster1.jpg)

 * Created a model which will take tweets from the twitter and classify that it will be disaster news or not.
 * Did Exploratory data analysis and analyse the length of the tweets with the help of histograms .
 * Use GLOVE (stanford nlp) to convert words into their corresponding word vectors.
 * Use Naive bayes Classifier and recurrent Neural Networks to make the model.
 * We find that Bidirectional LSTMs predict very efficiently.
 
 -------------------

### [ Project 1.2: "SPAM CLASSIFIER"](https://github.com/tejpal123456789/Natural-Language-Processing/blob/main/spam_classifer.ipynb)
 ![](/images/spam.jpg)

 * Created a deep learning model which will classify the text whether it is spam or ham.
 * Use nltk and spacy NLP libraries for preprocess the data.
 * Use keras word embeddings to convert the words into their corresponding word vectors.
 * Used LSTM(Recuurent Neural Networks) to train the model.

----------------------------
### [Project 1.3: "SARCASM DETECTION"](https://github.com/tejpal123456789/Natural-Language-Processing/blob/main/sarcasm_detection.ipynb)
![](/images/sarcasm.jpg)
 
 * Created a deep learning model which will classify the text whether it is spam or ham.
 * Use nltk and spacy NLP libraries for preprocess the data.
 * Use keras tensorflow word embeddings to convert the words into their corresponding word vectors.
 * Used Bidirectional LSTMs(Recuurent Neural Networks) to train the model.
 * Got the accuracy of 98% on the test data.

## [Project 2:  ChatBot](https://github.com/tejpal123456789/Chatbot/blob/main/Chatbot.ipynb)
  ![](/images/resize-1618594701874869920chatbot2.jpg)
  
"This project is based on natural language processing which will chat with human like a human."

* Build a simple chatbot with the artificial neural networks
* Used nltk natural language processing library for preprocessing the text
* Used Bag of words for the converting the words into vectors
* Created model with the keras and Neural Networks and started chatting with the bot

--------------------

## [Project 3: Machine Translation](https://github.com/tejpal123456789/Machine-Translation/blob/main/english_french.ipynb)
![](/images/resize-16185953212137604552translator.png)

 " This is one of the major project of my second year. Build a machine Translation engine which will translate the text into french and hindi "
 
 * Made a Translator of languages with the help of deep learning
 * Preprocessed the whole data with nltk and spacy
 * Converted the word into word vectors with the help of Glove.
 * Read the paper on encoder and decoder or Seq2Seq model and try to understand the concept and maths behind it.
 * Converted the paper into code with the help of keras tensorflow and Reccurent Neural Networks

## [Project 4: AI in Health Care](https://github.com/tejpal123456789/Implementation-of-ML-in-Health-Care-5-projects)
 
 ![](/images/resize-1618595582767751135heathcareai.jpg)
 
 "I have developed a disease predicting web app which using the concept of machine learning makes predictions about various diseases like cancer,heart, Diabetes etc."
 
 * Analyzed the performance of various machine learning algorithms in predicting the 5 Disease (Heart Disease,
  Breast Cancer,Diabetes,Liver Disease,Kidney disease )
 * Compared the performance of Ensemble and Boosting Classification techniques and Logistic Regression and focused to reduce the False Negative part of the confusion matrix
 * Used Streamlit for making [Web app](https://healthcare-app-prediction.herokuapp.com/) and Deployed the whole model on the Heroku Platform 


## [Project 5: Image Captioning](https://github.com/tejpal123456789/Image-Captioning/blob/main/Image_Captioning_Project_.ipynb)
